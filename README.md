## Personas
Dad will be 90 years old soon. He has a sell phone but doesn't really use it. He likes to clip newspaper articles and give to his 4 kids. He documented our lives until recently and has a lot of slides, picture and video. He was converting everything to DVDs and sending copies to us. We can call our landline or talk to him via WhatsApp video, but only with my stepmon's mobile. 

Stepmon is nearly 20 years younger and somewhat tech savvy. She takes care of Dad's life. His health and updates from us. 

My sister is an independent women that loves her cat. She uses instagram, facebook and WhatsApp but doesn't really post anything. She keeps track of all family birthday and other special dates.
